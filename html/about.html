        I feel grateful for being a part of the industry that most of all values skills, 
        ideas and hard work, encourages change and rewards passion.
        I’m looking for a place where I can learn and grow. I want to be challenged and hope to make an impact.

        When I’m not coding you can find me playing soccer, bouldering at Stone Summit or taking a nap. I love naps.
